## Installation/Operation Instructions
### Using Interface Builder
### Programmatically
The use of GridView programmatically is relatively simple. First, add GridView.h/.m into your project. Then import GridView into the View you wish to use it in. You can then use the following as a reference to adding it to your project:
```objective-c
GridView *_gv = [[GridView alloc] initWithGridFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 480) andBlockSize:CGSizeMake(40, 40)];
[self addSubview:_gv];
```
### Inserting/Removing Blocks
#### Inserting
There are many functions defined to allow for a multitude of customization when it comes to how you would like to add a view to the screen and into the Grid.
